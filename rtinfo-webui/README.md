# rtinfo Web UI
This directory contains 3 sub-projects:
- overview: aggregate all the informations for all or specific set of hostname
- table: provide mostly the same table as the ncurses version in html, with network and disks tables
- groupper: a beta version of some quick summary with more details

# Make it works
Currently, code is not made to be portable easily, this will be fixed soon.
For now, please change hardcoded links in rtinfo.js to make it points to a valid url where your json is.
