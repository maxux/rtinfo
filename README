   rtinfo-client / rtinfo-server
===================================

	rtinfo-client is able to monitor locally or remotely via udp using librtinfo
	rtinfo-server is an ncurses-based ui displaying rtinfo-client remote information

Dependencies
===========

	rtinfo-client depends on librtinfo
	rtinfo-server depends on libncurses
	both of them depends on librtinfo (http://git.maxux.net/librtinfo)

How to use it
=============

	The easy way is to type `make` inside rtinfo's root directory.
	If you want to compile only a specific part of the project, you can run `make` inside each corresponding folder (or make client / make server).
	
	There is no `make install` function at this time.
	
	
	To use rtinfo, just launch ./rtinfo-client/rtinfo-client, without any arguments. This will display your local system information.
	If you want to connect rtinfo-client to a server, just pass the server ip as the first argument:
		$ ./rtinfo-client/rtinfo-client 127.0.0.1 [port]
	
	To start the server: 
		$ ./rtinfo-server/rtinfo-server [--port] [--allow]
	
	Port and allow arguments are optional.
	
	Note: if you haven't installed the librtinfo, you should set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the correct lib path
	
	Warning: there is no encryption for the udp packets. If you are on a dangerous network, please consider 
	         using rtinfo over an ssh tunnel or an encrypted vpn.
		 Server may now restrict connection based on a list of allowed clients.
