librtinfo / rtinfo / rtinfo-server
==================================

	librtinfo is a very small library (~400 lines of C) for parsing linux system health
	rtinfo is able to monitor locally or remotly via udp
	rtinfo-server is a ncurses based ui displaying rtinfo-remote informations

Requirement
===========

	librtinfo just require some linux headers
	rtinfo require librtinfo
	rtinfo-server require libncurses

How to use it
=============

	The easy way is to type `make` on the rtinfo's root directory
	If you want to compile only a specific part of the project, you can make each folder alone
	
	There is no `make install` function at this time
	
	
	To use rtinfo, just launch rtinfo/rtinfo, without any arguments, it will display health locally
	If you want to connect rtinfo to a server, just put the server ip on first argument:
		$ ./rtinfo 127.0.0.1 [port optional]
	
	To start the server, just start it, or with a specific port on the first argument
		$ ./server [port optional]
	
	
	Warning: there is no encryption for the udp packet, if you are on a dangerous network, please concidere to
	         use it over ssh tunnel or a encrypted vpn. There is (at this time) no security check made on the server.
