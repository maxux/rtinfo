        rtinfod        depends on librtinfo
        rtinfo-ncurses depends on librtinfo and libncurses

How to use it
=============

	You need to compile each wanted sub-directory. Just type 'make' on it.
        There is no `make install` function at this time.

	1) Start a daemon:
		$ ./rtinfod/rtinfod
	
	2) Connect it a client
                $ ./rtinfo-client/rtinfo-client 127.0.0.1

        3) Connect it a remote
                $ ./rtinfo-ncurses/rtinfo-ncurses --host 127.0.0.1

        Warning: there is no encryption for the udp packets. If you are on a
                 dangerous/untrusted network, please consider using rtinfo
                 over an ssh tunnel or an encrypted vpn.

	The rtinfod send data in json format, well you can grab it and use data
	with any langage/lib/... you want. To get data, just make a
	HTTP GET request to /json on the rtinfod remote socket.

	Note: it's not a true web server on it. It just parse "GET /json" at
	this time.
