   rtinfo-client / rtinfo-server / rtinfo-local
==================================================

        rtinfo-client: is the remote udp client (using librtinfo)

        rtinfo-server is an ncurses-based ui displaying rtinfo-client remote
        information

        rtinfo-client is a local monitor with librtinfo

Dependencies
============

        rtinfo-client depends on librtinfo
        rtinfo-server depends on librtinfo and libncurses
        librtinfo can be found here: https://git.maxux.net/librtinfo

How to use it
=============

        The easy way is to type `make` inside rtinfo's root directory.
        If you want to compile only a specific part of the project, you can run
        `make` inside each corresponding folder
        (or make client / make server / make local).

        There is no `make install` function at this time.

        To use rtinfo, just run ./rtinfo-local/rtinfo-local, without arguments.
        This will display your local system information.

        If you want to use the client (what you want to do in the most case) to
        a server, just pass the server ip as the first argument of the
        rtinfo-client:
                $ ./rtinfo-client/rtinfo-client 127.0.0.1 [port]

        To start the server: 
                $ ./rtinfo-server/rtinfo-server [--port] [--allow]

        Port and allow arguments are optional.

        Note: if you haven't installed the librtinfo, you should set the
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the correct lib path.
	
        Warning: there is no encryption for the udp packets. If you are on a
                 dangerous/untrusted network, please consider  using rtinfo
                 over an ssh tunnel or an encrypted vpn.

                 Server may now restrict connection based on a list of
                 allowed clients.
