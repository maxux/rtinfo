librtinfo / rtinfo / rtinfo-server
==================================

	librtinfo is a very small library (~400 lines of C) to monitor the health of a linux system 
	rtinfo is able to monitor locally or remotely via udp
	rtinfo-server is an ncurses-based ui displaying rtinfo remote information

Dependencies
===========

	librtinfo just requires some linux headers
	rtinfo depends on librtinfo
	rtinfo-server depends on libncurses

How to use it
=============

	The easy way is to type `make` inside rtinfo's root directory.
	If you want to compile only a specific part of the project, you can run `make` inside each corresponding folder.
	
	There is no `make install` function at this time.
	
	
	To use rtinfo, just launch rtinfo/rtinfo, without any arguments. This will display your local system information.
	If you want to connect rtinfo to a server, just pass the server ip as the first argument:
		$ ./rtinfo 127.0.0.1 [port]
	
	To start the server: 
		$ ./server [port]
	
	Port argument is optional. 
	
	Warning: there is no encryption for the udp packets. If you are on a dangerous network, please consider 
	         using rtinfo over an ssh tunnel or an encrypted vpn.
		 Server is now able to allow a restricted remote client list.
